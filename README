--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The HELIOS program package provides a set of numerical routines for computing
resistive losses, heat dissipation, temperatures and radio frequency CW power
limits for horizontal rectangular waveguides and coaxial lines.
The underlying algorithms evaluate the radial heat transfer by conduction, 
convection and radiation for given media [ solid lossy dielectrics or gases
under variable pressure ] and derive inner temperature maxima, or transmitted
CW power limits for steady state operation.
   Note that the Newton-Raphson algorithm of this program is sensitive to
the chosen initial conditions, especially when the thermal resistances have
large scale differences. This is the case, for example, when the convective
thermal resistance between a coaxial inner and outer conductor is very much 
greater than the thermal resistance of the jacket (i.e. the outer conductor's
"mantle" ). In this case it can be helpful to artificially increase a small
thermal resistance slightly in order to reduce the scale differences. 
As a rule, this does not have a major impact on the calculated critical
temperature maxima and CW power limits, as these depend essentially on the 
large thermal resistances. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The underlying algorithms rely on theoretical and empirical results mostly
found in these
