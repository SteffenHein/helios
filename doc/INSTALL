INSTALL
Installation instructions for the HELIOS program package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HELIOS [ Heat and Electric Losses In Ordinary wave guiding Structures ],
release v1.0r1 

(C) SHEIN; Munich, January 2008                            Steffen Hein
[ Update: December 28, 2021 ]                           <contact@sfenx.de>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Copy the package file helios-v1.0r1.tgz into your home directory [ or where 
   you want to create the initial installation directory ~./helios-v1.0r1 ].
   In the following that directory is referred to as 'build directory'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Unpack the helios package, using the tar command

	tar -xvzf helios-v1.0r1.tgz
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Edit your [ operating system dependent ] makefile and define your  
   preferred program installation path [ viz. the directory /~ wherein the
   executable program helios.do shall reside ].
   Write that directory into Makefile as macro HELIOS_INST=/~. Take care that
   the directory lies on the default search path of your user environment
   [ usually defined in the .login, .profile, or the .bash_profile script ],
   or include that directory into your search path.
   Within Makefile, you may also configure your preferred C compiler options
   by modifying HELIOS_CC and the pertinent flag, HELIOS_FLAG, in the desired
   fashion [ in general, it is recommended to use optimization options, 
   in particular for computationally expensive subroutines and functions ].
   Then copy your configured makefile into the file named 'Makefile' or
   set a symbolic link, for instance [ if your makefile is makefile.unx in a 
   UNIX type operating system ], by entering the command:

        ln -s makefile.unx Makefile

   Note that the pre-configured makefiles [ makefile.gnu, makefile.unx ]
   added to this package use GNU Make [ or CMake ] syntax.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Edit the CONFIG.H header file and reconfigure, if necessary or wanted, the
   pertinent array dimensions [ macros ], always complying with the needs of
   your application. The CONFIG.H file usually resides in the directory

                            ~/helios-v1.0r1/.. 

   where ~/ denotes the build directory. With the default makefiles
   CONFIG.H is expected to reside in this directory at compilation time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Before compiling the sources, you should in addition specify your preferred 
   editor and line printer options at the top of the CONFIG.H script.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Compile and install the executable program directly into an indicated
   directory [ HELIOS_INST in Makefile ] by entering the command

        make install

   or into any intermediate directory HELIOS_PATH [ likewise specified in
   Makefile ] by doing a

        make helios.do

   In the latter case, you may individually move the compiled executable
   program [ helios.do ] into any other directory, where you want to install it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Finally you can do a

	make clean

   in order to remove all binary objects from the build directory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Change into your home directory [ or wherever you want to run your helios
   applications ] and start the executable program with the command

        helios.do

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Note that the numerical output is saved in GNUPLOT compatible format.

Thanks for using HELIOS
